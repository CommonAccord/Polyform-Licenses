Ti=Competition

sec=Goods and services compete even when they provide functionality through different kinds of interfaces or for different technical platforms.  Applications can compete with services, libraries with plugins, frameworks with development tools, and so on, even if they're written in different programming languages or for different computer architectures.  Goods and services compete even when provided free of charge.  If {_You} market a {_Product} as a practical substitute for the {_Software} or another {_Product}, it definitely competes.
